1. Copy ```js``` folder into the Jekyll project, including ```search.js``` and ```lunr.js```
2. Copy ```search.html``` into the root folder of the Jekyll project
3. Make sure ```layout``` in the front matter of ```search.html``` is set to a valid layout like the one you're using for the rest of the site
